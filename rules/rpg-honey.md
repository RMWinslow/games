# Honey Heist

Itâ€™s HoneyCon 2018 . You are about to undertake The Greatest Heist
the World Has Ever Seen. Two things:  
**One**: You have a complex plan that requires precise planning.  
**Two**: You are a *goddamn bear*.

## Rules:

### Stats

You have two stats: **Bear** and **Criminal**. Both Start at 3.

**Use Bear to:** maul stuff, run and climb, shrug off damage, scare
people, and generally do bear stuff.  
**Use Criminal to:** do anything not directly related to being a bear.

### Rolling Dice

When you do something risky, roll **1d6**. If the result is $\leq$ the relevant stat, you succeed. If it's over the stat, then you fail.

If you're doing something related to your Species or Role, roll 2d6 and take the lowest.


### Changing States

**Frustration**: When the plan fails and you run into difficulty, move
one point from Criminal into Bear.  
**Greed**: When the plan goes off without a hitch, move one point from
Bear into Criminal.

**Flashback Scene:** You can voluntarily move a point from Bear to Criminal by doing a flashback scene in which you and the other bears plan out the heist over coffee and cigarettes in the back room of a seedy bar.  
**Feed:** You can voluntarily move one point from Criminal to Bear by
eating a load of honey.


### The End

**If your Criminal stat reaches 6**, you are lured
into a life of crime and betray the party.  
**If your bear stat ever reaches 6**, you flip out bear-style and lose it, presumably to be picked up by animal
control in half an hour or so.
