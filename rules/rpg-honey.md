# Honey Heist

It’s HoneyCon 2018 . You are about to undertake The Greatest Heist
the World Has Ever Seen. Two things:  
**One**: You have a complex plan that requires precise planning.  
**Two**: You are a *goddamn bear*.

## Rules:

### Stats

You have two stats: **Bear** and **Criminal**. Both Start at 3.

**Use Bear to:** maul stuff, run and climb, shrug off damage, scare
people, and generally do bear stuff.  
**Use Criminal to:** do anything not directly related to being a bear.

### Rolling Dice

When you do something risky, roll **1d6**. If the result is $\leq$ the relevant stat, you succeed. If it's over the stat, then you fail.

If you're doing something related to your Species's Special Skill or to your Role, roll 2d6 and take the lowest.


### Changing States

**Frustration**: When the plan fails and you run into difficulty, move
one point from Criminal into Bear.  
**Greed**: When the plan goes off without a hitch, move one point from
Bear into Criminal.

**Flashback Scene:** You can voluntarily move a point from Bear to Criminal by doing a flashback scene in which you and the other bears plan out the heist over coffee and cigarettes in the back room of a seedy bar.  
**Feed:** You can voluntarily move one point from Criminal to Bear by
eating a load of honey.


### The End

**If your Criminal stat reaches 6**, you are lured
into a life of crime and betray the party.  
**If your bear stat ever reaches 6**, you flip out bear-style and lose it, presumably to be picked up by animal
control in half an hour or so.

## Character Creation

Name your bear, if you want. You’re not a talking bear, per se, but
you can sort of mangle human speech through your bear mouth,
maybe? (You can talk to each other, though.)

And finally, if you would like, you may optionally roll on the
