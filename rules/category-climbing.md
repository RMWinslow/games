# Climbing / Shedding Games

- Each player is dealt a hand of cards.
- The lead plays a valid pattern of cards from their hand.
- Subsequent players must either:
    - Play the same pattern but of higher rank.
    - Pass.
    - Play a Bomb. This outranks all non-bomb plays.
- Play can continue multiple times around the table like this.
- If all but one players pass in a row, then the last player to not pass takes all cards played, places them facedown, and leads with another pattern.
- Typical Valid Patterns:
    - Single: <span class="card">A</span>, Double: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span>, or Triple: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span>
