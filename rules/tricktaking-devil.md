# The Devil's Poker

*Good for a laugh or as part of another game.*


- Each player is dealt a single card. They **DO NOT** look at it.
- Everyone holds their card up to their forehead so that all other players can see it.
- Look at the other player's card to determine whether you have the highest-ranked card.
- Bid accordingly.
