# Playing Poker Games with a Mahjong Set

In theory, 
you can substitute a poker deck for a mahjong set 
and still use [standard poker hands](category-poker):

- Remove the flowers and seasons
- Play with all 4 sets of tiles
- Pip cards (coins, strings and myriads) are normal suits ranked 987654321
- Dragons and winds are put together in a suit of "specials"
    - The special suit cannot be used to form straights
    - but for tiebreakers, specials are ranked higher than pip cards:
        1. Red dragon
        2. Green dragon
        3. White dragon
        4. North wind
        5. South wind
        6. East wind
        7. West wind
        8. Pip cards 9-1

Although the probabilities of each hand will be different,
The *probability ranking* will be the same. 
4-of-a-kind will be more rare than full house etc.

[Here's a table](mahjong-poker-odds) comparing the probability of each poker hand.
