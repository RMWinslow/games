# Pool Betting Mechanic

General Idea is:
- Roll a pool of d6s to try to achieve success
- But you can control how many d6s are in the pool by taking a risk.


## From [The Pool](http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/the-pool) 
<!--http://indie-rpgs.com/reviews/7-->

### Character Creation
- Give yourself a starting **pool** of 12 dice.
- Write a 50 word description. 
- Underline their most important **traits**.
- You may spend $N^2$ dice to give $+N$ bonus to a trait.

### Rolling Dice
- The GM decides how many (1-3) dice to roll.
- Relevant traits with bonuses can add that many dice to the roll.
- Optionally, you may wager up to 9 dice from your pool
  - Those dice are added to the roll
  - But if the roll fails, remove those dice from your pool.
- If **at least one dice rolls a 1**, the roll is sucessful. Otherwise it is a failure.
- If the roll suceeded, choose one of these two options:
  - Add a dice to your pool.
    - GM will narrate the positive outcome.
  - Make a Monologue of Victory.
    - The Player narrates the positive outcome.
    - The only limitations:
      - Don't directly alter or kill other PCs
      - Respect the established facts and tone of the narrative
      - Keep it short.
- If the roll failed, you lose any wagered dice and the GM narrates a negative outcome.

### Between sessions

- Add +1d6 dice to your pool, up to a maximum of 9.
- Then you may transfer dice between players' pools.
- Add 15 words to your character description, then choose traits and bonuses. You can increase existing bonuses.

### Character Death
- Happens when you fail a roll in a lethal situation
- Choose to:
  - Go gentle into that good night
    - Accept Death
    - Make a final Monologue, describing your end. 
  - Rage, rage against the dying of the light
    - Make a final roll
    - 0 dice are rolled, and you cannot add trait bonuses.
    - All dice must come from wagers.
    - Each other player may pitch in up to 9 dice as wagers
    - No matter the outcome, these dice are removed from your pools.
    - If the roll succeeds, the GM describes how you survive.
    - If the roll fails, the GM describes how you die.



## [Houses of the Blooded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_the_Blooded)

- Players roll a d6s based on their FATE-style aspects.
- Before rolling, you can wager dice:
  - Remove that many dice from the roll and set them aside.
- The roll succeeds iff the sum is **at least 10.**
- If the roll succeeds, the player may **choose** whether their action was successful. 
- If the roll succeeded, each dice wagered allows the player to describe an additional fact about the result.
