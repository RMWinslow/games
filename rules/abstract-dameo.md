## Generic Checkers Rules

These are the commonalities between Checkers variants.
Variants will have different setup, movement, etc.

<details open markdown="block">
<summary>Click to collapse. (You probably know this stuff already.)</summary>

You know the basics.
- Players take turns moving pieces.
- All pieces on the board start as Men.
- Men move one square or can capture pieces by hopping over them.
- Capturing is mandatory and can be chained. 
- If your Man ends the turn on the back row, he is promoted to a King. Kings have better movement options.
- You win if you capture all your opponent's pieces or make it so they otherwise cannot make a move.

But there are a few rules which differe between countries.
These include how pieces move, the setup of the board, etc.
Take note of the following rules:

### Flying Kings

In variants with **Flying Kings**, Kings can move and capture across longer distances.
- A flying king can move in a straight line through as many empty spaces as he wants.
- A flying king still captures by jumping over exactly one enemy piece in a straight line. But he doesn't have to start or end the jump adjacent to that target piece.

Otherwise, a King moves one space and captures by two spaces, just like a Man.

### Majority Capture

All major checkers variants have mandatory capture.
But what if there are multiple capture sequences available?
In a variant with **Majority Capture**, you must choose a capture sequence 
which captures the most pieces.

Otherwise, you can freely choose which capture you want to do.


### Immediate Removal

In most variants, the captured pieces are all removed at the end of the turn. 
You can't capture the same piece twice, 
and dead pieces can thus sometimes 'block' additional captures.

In a variant with **Immediate Removal**,
captured pieces are hoovered up immediately.

An additional restriction is typically added to say that a King can't immediately turn 180° mid capture-sequence.

## Rules for Dameo

Dameo is one of the most highly rated Checkers Variants on BGG.
In Dameo, pieces have diagonal movement, but orthogonal capture.
There is also a group movement rule to get the Men into action more quickly.

## Rules for King's Court

- Men move one space **orthogonally**: ←↑→↓
- Men capture **orthogonally** ←↑→↓
- Capturing is optional.
- You may also jump over your own pieces. This doesn't remove them from the board.
- Pieces are never promoted.
- In the first two turns, no jumping is permitted. Each player enters the central 4x4 "court".
- After the first two turns, you immediately lose if you don't have any pieces in the court.

Comments on Russian Checkers
Not my favourite version of checkers but a VAST improvement over English Draughts/American Checkers or International Checkers both of which are in my opinion horrendously boring games. The best checkers variants I have, so far, encountered are Turkish Checkers, Frisian Checkers, Bashni and the modern Dameo. Russian Checkers is nowhere near the standard of these other games but it sort of feels like the rule set that English Draughts/American Checkers or International Checkers should have had to make them into games you'd actually bother to play at all.
Only differences to Brazilian checkers is that in a capturing sequence, men promote to Kings(Queens) and continue capturing; and that there is NO requirement to select the sequence with the maximum number of captures.


https://www.iggamecenter.com/en/rules/halma
Halma is a bit different. The goal is to move your pieces to the opposite corner.
That's basically chinese checkers rules.
Oh. Huh. 
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2386/chinese-checkers
Chinese Checkers is actually called Stern-Halma.

Other breakthrough games include breakthrough?
https://www.iggamecenter.com/en/rules/breakthrough

https://www.iggamecenter.com/en/rules/harzdame
Harzdame is standard checkers turned 45degrees


WP has a seperate page for Czech Checkers, but I don't really understand the key differences.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_draughts
It would make for a good pun though.

There's also American Pool Checkers,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pool_Checkers
which I think is just Brazilian Checkers with a endgame countdown.?


Several pages mention a dropped "Huff rule"
which means you can choose not to capture. But that destroys your own piece.
