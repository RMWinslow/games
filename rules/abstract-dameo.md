# Dameo
![Setup your pieces by placing them in a trapezoid on the first three rows of your board.](abstract-dameo.jpg)  
*More complex Checkers Variant, diagonal movement and orthogonal capture.*


## Winning
Capture all your opponent's pieces or make it so they can't move.

## Moving

- Men can move **forward** or **diagonally forward**: ↖⬆↗
    - one space by itself
    - by jumping over a straight  unbroken line of allied men (equivalently, move the entire line of men)
- Kings move like **chess-queens**
- If a Man ends his move on the back row, he is promoted to a King.

## Capturing

- Men capture by hopping over an enemy **forwards**, **backwards**, or **sideways** ←↑→↓
- Kings capture by moving **orthogonally through** the captured piece.
- Capturing is mandatory. 
    - You have to capture as many as possible.
- Multiple captures can happen in a turn
    - The pieces aren't removed until the end of the turn
    - You can't capture the same piece twice
    - So dead pieces can 'block' additional captures.
