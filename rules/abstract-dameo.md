## Generic Checkers Rules

<details open markdown="block">
<summary>Click to collapse. (You probably know this stuff already.)</summary>

These are the commonalities between Checkers variants.
Variants will have different setup, movement, etc.

### Winning

Capture all your opponent's pieces or make it so they otherwise cannot make a move.

### Movement and Capturing

- Players take turns moving pieces.
- Men move one space. <!--(Diagonally forwards in most variants.)-->
- Men capture by hopping over an adjacent enemy piece to the empty space on the other side.
- Kings move and capture in a similar manner.<!--, but have more options.-->
- In variants with **Flying Kings**, Kings can move and capture across longer distances.
    - A flying king can move in a straight line through as many empty spaces as he wants.
    - A flying king still captures by jumping over exactly one enemy piece in a straight line. But he doesn't have to start or end the jump adjacent to that target piece.

#### Mandatory Capturing

- Capturing is mandatory. If you can capture a piece, you can't choose to make a non-capturing move.
- Multiple captures can happen in a turn.
    - If the piece you just moved can capture again, it can and must do so as part of the same turn.
    - In most variant, the captured pieces are removed at the end of the turn. You can't capture the same piece twice, and dead pieces can thus sometimes 'block' additional captures.
    - In other variants, captured pieces are immediately removed. But pieces cannot immediate turn 180 for back-to-back captures.
- When multiple captures are available:
    - In some variants, you may freely choose which capture you want to do.
    - In other variants, You must choose a sequence which captures as many pieces as possible.

#### Promotion

- All pieces on the board start as Men.
- If a Man makes it to the back row, he is promoted to a King. 
    - In some variants, the Man is only promoted if he *ends the turn* in the back row.
    - In other variants, the Man can be promoted mid capture-sequence. He immediately becomes a King and can continue the capture sequence like one.

<!--
- If a Man ends his move on the back row, he is promoted to a King. 
- If a Man makes it to the back row in the middle of capture sequence, what happens?
    - In some variants, the Man immediately becomes a King and can continue the capture sequence.
    - In other variants, the Man is not promoted mid capture-sequence. He is only promoted if he ends his turn in the back row.

## Rules for Dameo

Dameo is one of the most highly rated Checkers Variants on BGG.
In Dameo, pieces have diagonal movement, but orthogonal capture.
There is also a group movement rule to get the Men into action more quickly.

Comments on Russian Checkers
Not my favourite version of checkers but a VAST improvement over English Draughts/American Checkers or International Checkers both of which are in my opinion horrendously boring games. The best checkers variants I have, so far, encountered are Turkish Checkers, Frisian Checkers, Bashni and the modern Dameo. Russian Checkers is nowhere near the standard of these other games but it sort of feels like the rule set that English Draughts/American Checkers or International Checkers should have had to make them into games you'd actually bother to play at all.
Only differences to Brazilian checkers is that in a capturing sequence, men promote to Kings(Queens) and continue capturing; and that there is NO requirement to select the sequence with the maximum number of captures.


https://www.iggamecenter.com/en/rules/halma
Halma is a bit different. The goal is to move your pieces to the opposite corner.
That's basically chinese checkers rules.
Oh. Huh. 
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2386/chinese-checkers
Chinese Checkers is actually called Stern-Halma.
