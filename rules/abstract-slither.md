## Rules for Slither

<!--called particlebond on iggamecenter-->

Slither is played on a square grid.

### Winning
One player wants to form a path of orthogonally-connected stones linking the top to the bottom of the board.  
The other wants to form such a path linking the left to the right.

### Each Turn

1. (optionally) Move one of your stones to an adjacent space, diagonally or orthogonally.
2.  Place one of your stones on an empty space.

No bare diagonals: After your move, two allied stones can't be diagonally adjacent unless both are orthogonally adjacent to the same third allied stone.

```
Fine:          Bare:      Crosscut:
    ????        ???        ???? 
    ???        ???        ???? 
```

This rule is required to prevent "crosscuts" which block both players from winning.


### Optional Advanced variant:

You can only move a stone if it's touching a group of stones containing both colors.

## Rules for Hex

Hex is an older game played on a rhombic hex grid.
Such a board is harder to find, but the rules can be simpler as a result.


### Winning
One player wants to form a path of stones linking the top to the bottom of the board.  
The other wants to form such a path linking the left to the right.


### Each Turn

1.  Place one of your stones on an empty space.

That's it.






## Similar Connection Games

Hex is the oldest game on this page. 
There have been many games since then with the same connection goal.
Most of these games are attempts to work around the difficulties of 
adapting Hex's mechanics to a square grid.


Y
: Y is like Hex, but played on a triangular hex grid and the objective is to connect all three sides.

Gonnect
: Gonnect is played on on a square grid with [Go mechanics](abstract-go) stapled on. 
: No movement. Bare-diagonals are allowed. Surrounded pieces are removed, as in Go.

Resolve
: Square grid. No movement. Bare diagonals are allowed.
: When a crosscut is formed, the active player swaps two stones in the formation to resolve the crosscut, and continues swapping until no crosscuts remain.

Rhode
: Square grid. No movement. Bare diagonals are allowed.
: If you have a bare diagonal on your turn, you have to place your piece to close it.
: At the end of your turn, remove any of your pieces that are part of crosscuts except for the one you just placed.

Vimbre
: Square grid. No movement. Bare diagonals are *not* allowed.
: Instead of moving, you can steal an enemy piece if it is orthogonally sandwiched between your pieces (OXO), and is orthogonally adjacent to an empty space. 


Quinten
: Square grid. No movement. Large regions of the board are automatically filled in.
: A *region* is a set of connected empty spaces which is closed under adjacency.
: A *valid territory* is a region which doesn't contain any 2x2 empty spaces.
: After placing each stone, fill in all valid territories with the color of stone which makes up the majority of its border. Ties are broken in favor of non-active player.

Shifty
: Square Grid. Either place or move a stone on your turn.
: Stones must be placed next to allied stones (after the first move).
: Stones move like a chess queen. To move a stone, it must start adjacent to an allied stone, and end *not* adjacent to any allied stones.
: Bare diagonals are allowed, but crosscuts are not.

Crossway
: Square grid. No movement. Bare diagonals are allowed, but crosscuts are not.
: Stones are connected both orthogonally *and diagonally*.

Kopano
: Kopano is like Crossway except that bare diagonals are only sometimes allowed.
: A stone can only be placed to make a bare diagonal if placing an enemy stone in the same position would also create a bare diagonal.

Havannah has more complicated movement patterns.
Atoll has more complicated goal zones on the borders. And played on a square hex grid.
Chain lightning lets only white (P2) connect diagonally. Start with any number of white on the board, then let the other player choose whether they want to play black or white.
