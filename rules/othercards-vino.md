# Vizzini's Battle of Wits

*Distilled bluffing.*

- The dealer deals one card, face down, to each player, including themself. Either a hearts card (wine) or a spades card (poison). 
    - The dealer knows what they've dealt out, and can choose what card to give to each player.
    - The other players can't look at their card yet.
    - The dealer must deal out at least one heart and one spade.
- Going around the table, each other player chooses to 'drink' or 'swap'.
   - If they swap, they trade face-down cards with another player.
   - If they drink, they flip over the card in front of them. That card can no longer be swapped.
- After everyone (except the dealer) has chosen their move, all of the cards are flipped up.
- Any player with a spades card (poison) in front of them is out of the game. Anyone with a hearts card (wine) gets to go to the next round.
- Start the round again with the remaining players. The dealer is now the first player to drink, or the next clockwise player if no surviving players chose to drink.
