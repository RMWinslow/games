# Pyramid Poker

This game requires "cards" which can stand on their sides.
Like mahjong style tiles.

- Deal each player 15 cards face down
- Players take turns putting cards onto a pyramid
    - Place the card so you can see its face but your opponent cannot
- Next, players take turns removing cards from the pyramid.
- When you take a card, place it in one of three hands in front of your: left middle or right
- After all cards are taken, compare each pair of hands. Winner is whoever wins 2 out of 3 of these matchups.
