# Lasers & Feelings

You are the crew of the interstellar scout ship **RAPTOR**. Your mission is to explore
uncharted regions of space, deal with aliens both friendly and deadly, and defend the Consortium
worlds against space dangers. **CAPTAIN DARCY** has been overcome by the strange psychic entity
known as *Something Else*, leaving you to fend for yourselves while he recovers in a medical pod.

## Rules:

### Rolling Dice

When you do something risky, roll **1d6**. Add **+1d6** if you’re
**prepared** and **+1d6** if you’re an **expert**.

Roll your dice and compare each die result to your
stat **number**:
- If you use **LASERS** you want to roll **under** your stat number.
    - LASERS means science, reason, technology, cold rationality, and calm precise action.
- If you use **FEELINGS** you want to roll **over** your number. 
  - FEELINGS means rapport, diplomacy, intuition, seduction, and wild passionate action.

Success varies on number of dice that succeed: 

<ol start="0">
    <li>Fail.</li>
    <li>Partial Success.</li>
    <li>Success.</li>
    <li>Critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get.</li>
</ol>

### Laser Feelings
If you **roll your number exactly**, then you get a special insight
into what’s going on. 
- Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. 
- You can change your action if you want to, 
- then roll again.

### Helping

If you want to help someone else who’s rolling,
say how you try to help and make a roll. 
If you succeed, give them **+1d6** for that action.
