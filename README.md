# Game Rules and Tools

[Pagat](https://www.pagat.com/) is great and all, but sometimes I don't need  a detailed history of the game, with fifteen different regional variants and a detailed explanation of the regionally-favored shuffling technique.

Sometimes I just want some bullet points reminding me how to count the score.
