title: Game Rules and Tools
nav_exclude: true
---

This subsite contains abridged game rules, mostly for card games. 

[Pagat](https://www.pagat.com/) is a great resource for card game rules, 
but sometimes I don't need a detailed history of the game, 
with fifteen different regional variants and a step-by-step explanation of the traditionally-favored shuffling technique.

Sometimes I just want some bullet points reminding me how to count the score.

Additionally, this site is not a general reference for all card games.
It contains only the rules for games that I personally have played.
