This subsite contains abridged game rules, mostly for card games. 

[Pagat](https://www.pagat.com/) is a great resource for card game rules, 
but sometimes I don't need a detailed history of the game, 
with fifteen different regional variants and a step-by-step explanation of the traditionally-favored shuffling technique.

Sometimes I just want some bullet points reminding me how to count the score.

Rules blurbs for games I know how to play, and assorted little widgets can be found in the navigation menu.
This site is not a general reference for all card games, only those I've personally played.

Card games should be assumed to use a standard 52 card deck unless otherwise mentioned.

## Folders

- `rules` contains rules for card games and abstract games. Instead of subfolders within `rules`, I use filename-prefixes.
- `ref` contains reference material for board games
- `tools` is for little random generator widgets
- `assets` contains a bit of extra css to make the cards work
