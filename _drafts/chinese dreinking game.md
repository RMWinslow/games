Like RoShamBo but more complicated.

- One the count of three, each player does two things:
  - Calls out a number from 0-10, excluding 5. {0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}
  - Throws out a hand with 0-5 fingers extended.
- Add up the fingers thrown out by both players
- If a player called out the right number, then the other player has to drink.
