I want each section to be self contained ruleswise.
- Maybe character creation by itself.
- Basic conflict resolution with the advice lamp and character stats
- Magic by itself as a chapter.
- Resource management with inventory and the like.
- Character advancement.

# GLOG style OSR but using Funko Dice

## Anatomy of the Dice

This game is designed to use the combat dice
from Heroscape, Heroquest, or Funkoverse. 
These dice are six-sided with an uneven distribution of symbols:

||Attack|Defense|Special|
|---|---|---|---|
|# of Faces|3|2|1|
|HeroQuest|💀|🛡|🐰|
|Heroscape|💀|🛡|blank|
|FunkoVerse|💥|🛡|❗|

<!--⛨🛡-->

- **Three** of the faces depict **Attacking** Symbols. In HeroScape and HeroQuest, these faces have a skull. In FunkoVerse, these faces have a burst symbol.
- **Two** of the faces depict **Defensive** Symbols. In all three of the above-mentioned games, 
- **One** face is **Special**. In Heroquest, this face has a picture of a rabbit. In Heroscape, this face is left blank. And in FunkoVerse, this face has three exclamation points on it.

I happen to have a bulk load of FunkoVerse dice, so I will be using the symbols 💥, 🛡, and ❗ throughout the rest of these rules.

## Character Creation

## Character Anatomy

Characters have the following attributes:

- STRength, which is used to power through.
- DEXterity, which is used to move and dodge.
- CONstitution, which is used to endure physical hardship.
- CHArm, which determines social grace and mystical aptitude.
- WISdom, which is used to endure mental hardship. determines mental fortitude and willpower.
- Luck, 

MORale instead of wisdom?
Speed?

Also, keep note of the following, which all start at zero:

- Wounds. If a character has more wounds than 
- Stress
- Magic Dice Pool. 

## Core principles.

Insert advice lamp here.

The GM presents a scenario. Players describe their response. 
GM describes what happens.

- When the outcome is in doubt, roll to find out.
- Good plans don't roll.
- Giving up resources gives you more dice to roll.

## Rolling Dice

To "Roll STAT" means to roll a number of dice equal to the value of that Stat.

The GM can treat 2 as the baseline in all stats, if they're rolling for an npc where the stat isn't specified.

Expend scarce resources to get fictional advanatges and roll extra dice.

### Challenges

When one character is trying to force some outcome on another.

Choose the most appropriate Stat for both the aggresor and the defender.

STAT Challenge against STAT To OUTCOME

#### Examples:

- Attacking with a Weapon: STR Challenge vs CON.. If you suceed, the attacker suffers takes a wound.
- Lying: CHA Challenge vs WIS
- Chases: DEX Challenge vs DEX. The aggressor is trying to catch the defender. The person running away can drop items to gain advantage.
- Intimidation: STR Challenge vs WIS. If successful, defender runs away or takes a stress.

### Saves

The GM tells the player what to stat to roll. 
If they roll at least one 🛡, they successfully save and avoid some harm.

#### Examples:

- That tasty dinner was rigged to explode. Save vs DEX or suffer a wound.
- That tasty dinner was poisoned. Save vs CON or pass out.


### Generic Rolls

### Magic

When a character casts a spell:
- They choose how many MD to spend from their mana pool.
- Check the dice for outcome. 
- 🛡s are returned to your mana pool.
- spell outcome can depend on number of dice rolled, number of bursts,  etc.
- specials rolled count towards 

### Luck Pool

## Action Economy

## Resource Management

### Inventory slots

See appendix b for some items card to cut out.

### Wounds and Deprivation

### Expedition resources.

### Marking usage

### Getting tricksy with items

Maybe add some UVG stuff in here?

## Turn-based combat.

In the spirit of The Manse, have armor which simply negates unarmed attacks.

Note: In Heroquest, Monsters like goblins have Move, Attack, Defend, Body and Mind as stats.

Setting assumptions? It is difficult for PCs to get back to town. Doing so signals the end of a mini adventure.
