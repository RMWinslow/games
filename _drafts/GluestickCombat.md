This is a quick note file for adapting glog magic to hero dice.

Should be later cleaned and merged with main rules.

## Skerples Glog

- Attack chance is x-in-20 where x is (11 + (10 - enemy dex) -  2 for leather)
- deal d8+STR bonus with one hand sword
- hp is con - 4 for level 1 character
- if all stats are at 11, then 45% chance to hit. Need expected 7/4.5 hits to reduce to 0 hp or less
- so that' what, 3 or 4 hits to gank a dude?
